The entropy viscosity method has been successfully applied to three hyperbolic system of equations: the multi-D Euler equations, the $1$-D seven equation model and the $1$-D grey radiation-hydrodynamic equations. The numerical method was implemented using a continuous Galerkin finite element method and a second-order implicit temporal solver. The method relies on the derivation of dissipative terms consistent with the entropy inequality in order to ensure uniqueness of the numerical solution, and, on the definition of smart viscosity coefficients that are able to detect shock waves and discontinuities, which allows second-order accuracy when the numerical solution is smooth. More precisely, the viscosity coefficients are defined proportional to the entropy residual that is known to be peaked in the shock region, and also to the inter element jumps that will allow detection of other discontinuities. The definition of the viscosity coefficients also requires a normalization parameter that is derived using the non-dimensionalized form of the hyperbolic system of equations under consideration, in order to have well-scaled dissipative terms. \\

This approach allowed us to derive and present a new version of the entropy viscosity method valid for a wide range of Mach number when applying the entropy viscosity method to the multi-D Euler equations. The definition of the viscosity coefficients is now consistent with the low Mach asymptotic limit, does not require an analytical expression of the entropy function, and thus, could be used with any equation of state having a convex entropy. Tests were performed with the Ideal and Stiffened Gas equation of states. In 1-D, convergence of the numerical solution (either smooth or with shocks) to the exact solution was demonstrated by computing the convergence rates of the L$1$ and L$2$ norms of the error for flows in convergence-divergent nozzle and a straight pipe. 2-D simulations were also performed for both subsonic and supersonic flows, and various geometries: the entropy viscosity method behaves well for a wide range of Mach number. The numerical results obtained for a flow over a circular bump (subsonic and transonic flows) illustrates the capabilities of the method to adapt to the flow type.

Effect of source terms onto the entropy viscosity method was also investigated and explanations were provided on how to account for the source terms in the definition of the viscosity coefficients. $1$-D tests were performed for a simple model of a PWR using RELAP-7, and showed promising results. \\

The entropy viscosity method was also applied to the $1$-D seven equation model. The first step consisted in deriving the dissipative terms consistent with the entropy inequality, and also with the limit case $\alpha_k \to 1$ (the seven equation model degenerates into the single phase Euler equations). Then, definition of the viscosity coefficients was proposed using the same approach as the multi-D Euler equations. The volume fraction equation was handled by analogy to Burger's equation. \\

In this dissertation, we have also shown that the entropy-based viscosity method is a valid candidate for solving the 1-D radiation-hydrodynamic equations. A theoretical derivation is given for the derivation of the dissipative terms that are consistent with the entropy minimum principle. The viscosity coefficient $\kappa$ is defined proportional to the entropy residual that measures the local entropy production allowing detection of shocks. Through the manufactured solution method, it is demonstrated, firstly, that second-order accuracy is achieved when the solution is smooth, and secondly, that the artificial dissipative terms do not affect the physical solution in the equilibrium-diffusion limit. 

The entropy-based numerical scheme also behaves well in the tests performed for Mach numbers ranging from $1.05$ to $50$. The main features such as the embedded hydrodynamic shock and the Zeldovich spike are resolved accurately without spurious oscillations. The viscosity coefficient is peaked in the shock region only and behaves as expected. All of these results were obtained by using an unique definition of the viscosity coefficient that is computed on the fly. The addition of dissipative terms to the set of equations requires more computational work but is rather simple to implement.
As future work, extension to the multi-D equations could be considered: all of the derivations presented in this paper hold. The definition of the viscosity coefficients $\kappa$ and $\kappa_{max}$ do not need to be modified. It would be interesting to model the radiation equation with an $S_n$ transport approximation and apply the entropy based artificial viscosity to the resultant radiation-hydrodynamics equations. Given the advective nature of the $S_n$ equations, dissipation would need to be added to these equations.
