\indent This research project would not have been possible without the support of many people. First of all, I wish to express my gratitude to my advisor, Dr. Jean C. Ragusa, who was abundantly helpful and offered invaluable assistance, support and guidance. 

I would like to sincerely thank my co-advisor Dr. Jean-Luc Guermond for giving me valuable ideas. I cannot forget to thank Dr. Ray Berry for his most appreciated collaboration and useful suggestions.

I would like to express my special thanks to the MOOSE community, especially the MOOSE team, for replying to all my requests.

I am forever indebted to my father Gerard Delchini and my mother Nicole Delchini for their love, understanding, endless patience and encouragement when it was most required. Finally, yet importandly, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to my beloved wife Emmanuelle for her love, support and encouragement during the entire period of this work.
