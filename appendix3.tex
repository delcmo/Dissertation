\chapter{\uppercase{Entropy residual for an isentropic flow:}} \label{app:ise_equ}

This appendix aims at showing that the entropy residual is null when assuming an isentropic flow. \\
The entropy residual as a function of the pressure, the density, the velocity and the speed of sound is recalled here:
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:app_entr}
\resinew = \frac{dP}{dt} - c^2 \frac{d \rho}{dt}
\end{equation}
%
Assuming an isentropic flow, the pressure is only a function of the density as follows: $P = f( \rho )$ or $\rho = f^{-1}( P )$. Using the definition of the speed of sound $c^2 = \left. \frac{\partial P}{\partial \rho} \right)_s$ and the above form the equation of state, the following relation is derived:
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:app_sp}
c^2 = \left. \frac{\partial P}{\partial \rho} \right)_s = \frac{d P}{d \rho} = \frac{d f(\rho)}{d \rho}
\end{equation}
%
Using the chain rule, the entropy residual of \eqt{eq:app_entr} can be recast as a function of the density, the velocity and the speed of sound, and proven equal to zero:
%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\resinew &=& \frac{d f(\rho)}{d \rho} \frac{d\rho}{dt} - c^2 \frac{d \rho}{dt} \\
\resinew &=& c^2 \frac{d\rho}{dt} - c^2 \frac{d \rho}{dt} \\
\resinew &=&  0 
\end{eqnarray*}
